            <p class="title-text">
                After years of grappling with the idea, I finally decided to stop second-guessing myself and take the leap: I went back to school to pursue my long-time dream of working in technology. It wasn’t an easy decision, but it was the right one. I knew I wanted a career where I could be both creative and analytical, where I could solve real-world problems and constantly learn something new—and tech checked all those boxes.
                <br>
                As I moved through my coursework and certifications, I found myself especially drawn to web development. There’s something incredibly rewarding about taking an idea, turning it into a functional, visual experience, and watching it come to life online. This blog is not only a space for sharing my experiences, but also a part of that learning journey—my own little sandbox where I experiment, build, and grow.
                <br>
                Right now, I’m focused on leveling up my skills, embracing new challenges, and finding joy in the messiness of learning. Whether you're here for the tech tips, the career reflections, or just to follow along with the journey—thank you for being part of it.

            <a href="oops-i-cut-the-internet.html" class="post-title">Oops, I Cut the Internet! A Backyard Blunder Turned Tech Triumph</a>
            <span class="post-date">18 Jul 2025</span>
            <p class="post-description">
                Picture this: a sunny afternoon, the smell of fresh-cut grass, and me, out in the yard, channeling my inner landscaper. I’m dodging sprinkler heads, sidestepping garden gnomes, and carefully avoiding that all-important internet cable snaking through the dirt like a digital lifeline. But, as fate would have it, my trusty shovel had other plans. Snip! One rogue slice, and I’m staring at a severed cable, my Wi-Fi dreams fading faster than my phone’s signal. Cue the dramatic music—this is where my backyard blunder turns into a tech adventure for the ages.
                <br>
                Now, I’m no stranger to tech. I’ve got my A+ certification, my Network+ certification, and enough confidence to think, “Pfft, I’ve got this!” The cable looked like a standard RG-6 to my semi-trained eye, so I hopped in my car, zoomed to Home Depot like a tech superhero, and snagged a repair kit. Back home, I’m ready to save the day. But—plot twist—the cable just flopped in the crimper like a fish out of water. Frustration level: expert. I’m one step away from shaking my fist at the tech gods.
                <br>
                Determined not to let this cable catastrophe win, I dove into some serious detective work. A bit of research later, and eureka!—it’s not an RG-6, but an RG-56, the kind of cable you’d find in a house that’s been standing since the Beatles were topping the charts. My 60-year-old home was throwing me a retro curveball, but I wasn’t about to let it dial-up my stress levels any further.
                <br>
                Back to Home Depot I went, now armed with the knowledge of a cable connoisseur. I tracked down the right RG-56 repair kit, raced home, and queued up a couple of YouTube tutorials for good measure. With the precision of a surgeon (or at least a very focused DIYer), I cut, connected, and crimped that cable back to life. Voila! The internet was back, streaming gloriously like nothing ever happened.
                <br>
                What’s the moral of this backyard saga? Sometimes, life’s best lessons come from a little dirt, a lot of determination, and a willingness to laugh at your own mistakes. Sure, I cut the cable, but I also rewired my confidence and proved that even a tech mishap can turn into a triumph. So, next time you’re out in the yard, keep an eye on those cables—and maybe keep a repair kit handy, just in case.
